The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on projects. You don’t have to worry about losing data on your hard drive or managing a project across multiple computers — sync from anywhere. Most importantly, GitHub is a collaborative and asynchronous workflow for building software better, together.

This guide walks you through the GitHub Essentials: Repositories, Branches, Commits, Issues and Pull Requests.

With these skills, you’ll go far. And with this hello-world repository you’ll have a place to store ideas (aka future repositories, like jlord/hello-world), resources or other general notes, even discuss things with others (like holman/feedback).

Install & Code Free Zone

We’re going to complete the tasks in this tutorial using GitHub.com, so you don’t have to know the command line or even install Git (which is the change-tracking software GitHub is built on). You don’t even need to know how to code. You will, however, need a GitHub account, so sign up if you don’t have one!

Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.

Create a Repository
A repository is the basic unit of GitHub, most commonly a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, including images – anything your project needs. Because we recommend including a README, or a file describing the project, in every repository, GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file, but we can skip that for now.
